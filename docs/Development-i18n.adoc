= Internationalization (i18n)

== Intro

Translation messages for Beavy core, as well as Beavy apps and modules, use the
http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages[ICU Syntax]. The
translation messages themselves are managed with the
http://docs.transifex.com/introduction/[Transifex]
localization platform, using English as the default language.

Please see BeavyHQ's transifex dashboard here:

https://www.transifex.com/beavy[transifex.com/beavy]

If you would like to help us translate Beavy, please let us know or click the
"Help Translate Beavy" button on the link above.

== ICU syntax

ICU messages are strings that frequently contains variables such as names, dates
and numbers. A relatively, simple ICU message looks like this:

 {name} likes the Beavy framework

Here's a more complex example, handling pluralization:

```
There is {number, plural,
  =0 {no}
  one {one}
  other {#}} framework to rule them all.
```

For a more detailed explanation of the ICU syntax, please consult this
http://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/[excellent guide] from the
http://format.js.io[FormatJS website].

== Working with translation files

New and updated translations will be regularly checked into the Beavy code base,
so you may not need to work directly with the translation files. However, if it
becomes necessary manipulate the translation files directly, you will need to
configure the Transifex client in your Beavy development environment. Please see
http://docs.transifex.com/tutorials/client/[this guide] for instructions.

Once you've configured the client, you can begin the translation workflow. That
workflow consists of a few simple steps:

  . Write new (or update) translations on the frontend or backend (see 3.1).
  . Extract the translations & push them to Transifex (see 3.2).
  . Translate them (or wait for them to be translated) on Transifex.
  . Update the translation files locally from Transifex (see 3.3).

Good luck!

=== Writing translations

==== Python (server-side) translations

Backend translations in python are accomplished using the following functions
(supported by http://github.com/beavyHQ/flask-icu[Flask-ICU]):

   * `format()`
   * `format_date()`
   * `format_time()`
   * `format_datetime()`
   * `format_number()`
   * `format_decimal()`
   * `format_currency()`
   * `format_scientific()`
   * `format_percent()`

==== Javascript (client-side) translations:*

=== Extracting & pushing to Transifex

If you have added new localizations to your Beavy implementation, you need to
"extract" the messages from the code, and upload the message keys to Transifex
for translation.

To do this issue these commands from inside the vagrant instance (i.e. inside the
vagrant guest):

 npm extract-messages && tx push -t

=== Updating from Transifex

Once new localization messages have been translated on Transifex, they can be
quickly pulled down into your app by running the following command from within
the vagrant instance:

 tx pull -a && tx pull -l en

== Shipping your own translations (for your app)
