The frontend is build with ES2015 (the Version 2015 of EcmaScript) and with the JSX extension for inline dom-annotations. To build the frontend, beavy ships with a setup of webpack configuration files for development (including a hot-reloading development server) and production builds.


=== Client Architecture

The data flow in the frontend is managed using the Redux pattern (which is an extension of the famous flux pattern).
